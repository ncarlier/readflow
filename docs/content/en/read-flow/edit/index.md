It is possible to modify an article partially.
This allows you to improve its organization and to add your own notes.

Click on the contextual menu to access the edit button of an article:

You can then modify:

- the title
- the text
- and the category

The title and text can contain hashtags (a keyword preceded by a "#").
Hashtags added in this way are associated with the article and can be used in the search engine.
