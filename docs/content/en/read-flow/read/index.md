The reading flows are organized as follows:

- The main flow: It includes all the unread articles.
- Categories: They allow you to split your reading flow.
- Stared articles: They include the items you have kept.
- The history: It includes all the articles read.

To mark an article as read, you must click on the mark button.
If you are using a mobile phone, you can also swipe the article to the left.
It will separate and be marked as read.
